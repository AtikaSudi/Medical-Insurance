## Demonstrated skills in various fields.

+ Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, resolving missing values, and addressing mixed or incorrect data types.

+ Conducting exploratory visual analysis using relevant Python libraries

+  Preparing data for regression analysis.
  
+  Splitting the data into two sets: a training set and a test set.
  
+  Running a linear regression on the data and analysing the model performance statistics.

+  Preparing data for cluster analysis.
   
+   Using the elbow technique to determine the optimal number of clusters.

+   Runing the k-means algorithm.
    
+ Creating a variety of different visualizations using clustered data.

+ The descriptive statistics for clusters using the group by () function was calculated before the findings were discussed and any proposed next steps.
